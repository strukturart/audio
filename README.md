### Podcast downloader
Put on your sd card a file with the name `audio.json` with the following structure:


```
[
	
		{
			"url":"http://www.ndr.de/podcast/podcast3008.xml",
			"episodes":"2",
			"dir":"ndr"
		},
		{
			"url":"http://podcast.wdr.de/radio/leonardo.xml",
			"episodes":"2",
			"dir":"wdr"
		},
		{
			"download_path":"/storage/sdcard/podcast/"
		}
]

```

Create the root podcast dir manually for example /storage/sdcard/**podcast**/

be very careful when specifying the download path: "download_path": "/storage/sdcard/podcast/"
because it can happen that if you set the wrong download path overrides your system
do a test before with adb shell!!

### to do

- add id3 tag-reader to create more readable file names
- delete old podcast episodes
⁻ when playing big files >100mb crash the app
